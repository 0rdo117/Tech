Rex: Network Segmentation and VLAN Setup Documentation
1. Objective:
The goal was to set up and document the network segmentation and VLAN structure for your cyber lab setup. This configuration is critical for organizing traffic flow, securing sensitive parts of the network, and enabling efficient management of various devices and services in your environment.

2. Network Segmentation Overview:
Network segmentation involves dividing the network into multiple smaller, isolated sections, which helps with security, performance, and ease of management. In your case, you are using VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to logically separate the network based on function, role, or sensitivity level.

3. VLAN Configuration:
You decided to shift the VLANs in your cyber lab by 10, meaning your previously configured VLAN numbers are increased by 10. This will help avoid any overlap with other network configurations, especially when scaling or integrating new devices.

VLAN Range Change: All VLAN IDs were increased by 10.

Example:

VLAN 20 → (Management)

VLAN 30 → (Blue Team)

VLAN 40 → (Red Team)

4. VLANs in Your Network Setup:
Here are the key VLANs in your configuration:

VLAN 20: Management VLAN

VLAN 30: Blue Team VLAN

VLAN 40: Red Team VLAN

5. Network Configuration Tools:
To configure the VLANs, you used tools like:

HP ProCurve Switch (J9146A)

Netgear AX4200 Router

The ProCurve switch and the Netgear router are responsible for routing the traffic between these VLANs while ensuring isolation and security.
